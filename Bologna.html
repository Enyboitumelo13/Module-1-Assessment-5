        <h1>Welcome to Bologna!</h1>
        <p>Bologna gets its name from a city in Italy also called Bologna. They do have bologna there, but it’s called mortadella. Mortadella is essentially the grandfather of the bologna everyone knows and loves in the United States. 
            Both meats primarily use the same ingredients. American bologna generally consists of pork, beef or a combination of the two. This meat is then blended together seamlessly. Spices and other ingredients might be added to the mix. Some of the more popular additions include:
            •	Coriander
            •	Celery seed
            •	Allspice
            •	Nutmeg
            •	Myrtle berries
            •	Black pepper
            It seems that mortadella, the precursor to modern bologna, has been around for centuries. It became a real delicacy in the town of Bologna as early as the 1400s. Anyone who passes through the town absolutely has to try a piece of this delectable sausage.
